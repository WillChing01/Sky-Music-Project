NORMS:

- if you call state 'somethingSomething', the setting state function should be called 
 'setSomethingSomething'

- don't use spaces around square-brackets when building arrays, as in '[ varA, varB ]'. do like 
  '[varA, varB]'

- put spaces between arguments in functions, like 'console.log('Hello, ', 'World.')', not like 
 'console.log('Hello, ','World.')'

- inline if statements -- 'if (<condition>) <execute>;' -- should not use curly braces like 
  'if (<condition>) {<execute>;}'

- use unambiguous variable names

- when using 'if {} else {}', the else clause should begin on the same line as the closing brace of 
  the if clause 

- put a space between (the opening bracket for the condition of an if clause) and (the 'if' keyword),
  like 'if (<condition>) <code>', not 'if(<condition>) <code>'.

- don't write this: 'if (<conditionA>) <conditionB> ? <executeX>
                                                    : <executeY>; 

- don't consume the event in a handler -- like 'const handleEvent = (e) => {<code>};' -- unless you 
  are going to use that event

- write single argument arrow functions like (e) => {}  

- space out the colon for inline ternary operators like <condition> ? <executeA> : <executeB>

- order imports by functions, components, css, with return whitespace separating these categories

NOTES:

- there are a couple things of note about booleans and how truthy/falsy works in JS that Adam can
resolve with Will

- NORMS are open to revision/addition
